## What is T-CAD?


T-CAD is a computer-aided dispatch or mobile data terminal system for FiveM roleplay communities, and the official CAD/MDT of Lockhart RP. Optionally, T-CAD can integrate with your server to provide real-time data to your members.



## How to deploy?

Deploying T-CAD on your own server is easy! Just follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal and navigate to your documents folder. 

    * Example: ````C:/Users/Username/Documents/ ````

2. Use ```` git clone ```` to clone the repo into your documents folder.

3. Navigate into the ````t-cad```` folder.
4. Use ````npm run build```` to compile the application locally.
5. After the application is successfully compiled, run ````npm run start```` to start the server.
6. Nagivate to ````http://localhost:3000```` in your browser to access the application.
